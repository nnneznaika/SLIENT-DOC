### PDF Slient Exploit Information ###

One of the most complex tasks for the cyber security expert is to ensure their malicious code goes detected by antivirus and achieves its goal. For this, they have invested a lot on more complex infection processes, going beyond the traditional Exploit PDF and using techniques where the malicious payload is hidden in encrypted

files – even using a known file format. This is what we found in a new PDF Exploit in the wild: it tries to conceal the malicious files in a Exploit PDF File. And the prevent attack starts with a simple Exploit PDF. Provides Good Security.

**Closer inspection of the Exploit PDF content reveals the malicious link as well as the URL Download and Execute of the tool used to generate the Exploit PDF from 

Python encrypted code content which we also implement in couple of our builders.**

## About CVE

**CVE was launched in 1999 when most information security tools used their own databases with their own names for security vulnerabilities. At that time there was no significant variation among products and no easy way to determine when the different databases were referring to the same problem.**
